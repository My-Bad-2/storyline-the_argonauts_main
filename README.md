## Description
This project is a foundational implementation of a storytelling website centered around the tale of Orpheon, a warrior whose journey unfolds in the aftermath of the Trojan War. The narrative is set during the pivotal moment when the Greeks successfully deceived the Trojans with the infamous Wooden Horse, presented as "A Gift for Athena."

The websiteâ€™s design is inspired by the principles of Minimalism, focusing on clean aesthetics and an immersive user experience. While this is an initial version, the project holds significant potential for further development into a comprehensive platform capable of dynamically narrating various epics and legendary tales. Future enhancements could include interactive storytelling features, multimedia integration, and a flexible framework to accommodate a broader range of mythological and historical narratives.

### Background
The Trojan War was a legendary conflict in Greek mythology that took place around the 12th or 13th century BC. The war was waged by the Achaeans (Greeks) against the city of Troy after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology, and it has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably Homer's Iliad.
