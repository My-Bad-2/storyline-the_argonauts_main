## Description
This project is a foundational implementation of a storytelling website centered around the tale of Orpheon, a warrior whose journey unfolds in the aftermath of the Trojan War. The narrative is set during the pivotal moment when the Greeks successfully deceived the Trojans with the infamous Wooden Horse, presented as "A Gift for Athena."

The website’s design is inspired by the principles of Minimalism, focusing on clean aesthetics and an immersive user experience. While this is an initial version, the project holds significant potential for further development into a comprehensive platform capable of dynamically narrating various epics and legendary tales. Future enhancements could include interactive storytelling features, multimedia integration, and a flexible framework to accommodate a broader range of mythological and historical narratives.

### Background
The Trojan War was a legendary conflict in Greek mythology that took place around the 12th or 13th century BC. The war was waged by the Achaeans (Greeks) against the city of Troy after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology, and it has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably Homer's Iliad. 

### **Gist of *The Last Omen: A Tale of the Trojan War***  
In the final hours of Troy, fate and free will collide as the city unknowingly seals its own doom. Orpheon, a weary Trojan warrior, suspects that the Greeks’ so-called offering—the infamous wooden horse—is a trap. Despite the desperate warnings of Cassandra, whose prophecies are forever ignored, the people of Troy embrace the gift as a symbol of divine mercy.  

As the gods of Olympus observe from above, they wager on the power of choice versus the certainty of destiny. While Athena stands firm in her support of the Greeks, Apollo and Poseidon recognize the flicker of defiance in Orpheon, questioning whether one man’s resistance can alter the inevitable.  

Orpheon’s attempt to expose the truth is met with hostility, and his defiance is swiftly silenced with a spear. Left for dead, he bears witness to the city’s final betrayal as Greek soldiers emerge from the horse and open the gates for their waiting army. Fire and blood consume Troy as the gods look on, their amusement tinged with melancholy.  

As he breathes his last, Orpheon gazes toward the heavens, whispering a question that lingers even among the immortals: *Was it always meant to be?*  

With the city in ruins and the Fates whispering over the fallen, the story concludes as it began—with destiny fulfilled, and mortals left to suffer its weight.
