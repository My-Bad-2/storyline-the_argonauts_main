          Far above the mortal world, where the concerns of men were little more than whispers in the wind, the halls of
          Mount Olympus stood bathed in ethereal light. Clouds drifted lazily through marble columns, their edges
          glowing gold with the last light of the sun. Here, gods feasted, schemed, and, more often than not, placed
          wagers on the fates of men.

          Poseidon leaned against a great pillar, arms crossed over his chest, his trident resting idly at his side. He
          gazed down at the world below, at the flickering torchlight of Troy, a city on the precipice of destruction.
          The tides had already turned against it—he had made sure of that. And yet, something still held him there,
          watching. He exhaled, shaking his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Troy is breathing its last,” he muttered, more to himself than to anyone in particular. “The tide is set. And
          yet… there is resistance still. One mortal struggles against the current.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Across the great hall, Athena rolled her eyes and took a sip of her wine. “Oh, please, Poseidon. One mortal?
          Really? You've seen how this works.” She gestured lazily toward the mortal realm. “It doesn't matter how much
          he resists. Fate is carved in stone, and my favor lies with the Greeks. He is nothing but a leaf in a storm.”
        </p>

          Apollo, reclining nearby with his lyre resting against his knee, smirked. “A leaf, perhaps,” he said, plucking
          a single golden note from his instrument, “but even the smallest ripple can change the course of the ocean.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Poseidon raised an eyebrow. “I like that.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Apollo grinned. “I thought you might.”
        <p>
          Athena let out an exaggerated sigh. “You two are unbearable. Always so sentimental. You act as if the struggle
          itself is worth something.”
        </p>

      <div class="inner">
        <p>
          Apollo stretched lazily, tilting his head toward the city below. “If struggle were meaningless, why would we
          bother playing this game at all?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The conversation was interrupted by a faint whisper that curled through the air like a thread unraveling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Fates had spoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thread. One choice. One end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words drifted between the gods, carrying the weight of certainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Poseidon frowned. He had seen too many men fall to fate's unyielding grip, but this one… this Orpheon…
          something about him felt different. The moment hung in the air, fragile, waiting to break.
        </p>
        <p>
          Athena smirked and set her cup down. “Foolish mortal,” she said, watching as Orpheon stood below, staring at
          the wooden horse with suspicion. “Even if he defies the will of kings, what can one man possibly change?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The golden light of Olympus flickered for a moment, as if the universe itself hesitated to answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Far below, Orpheon took a slow, steady breath.
        <p>
          The gods watched.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game continued.
