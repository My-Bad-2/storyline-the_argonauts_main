        <p>Midnight draped its heavy cloak over Troy, the city sleeping under a sky thick with stars. Somewhere in the
          distance, the last remnants of celebration had faded into the quiet hum of embers and the occasional clink of
          a dropped goblet. The wooden horse stood tall and silent in the city square, its presence as absurd as it was
          ominous.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>At the base of the walls, just beyond the great gates, the Greek army waited, their breaths shallow, their
          hands gripping their weapons. Among them stood Odysseus, his expression calm, patient. He was a man who knew
          how to wait for the perfect moment to strike.</p>
        <p>He turned to his men, his voice barely above a whisper. “Any moment now.”</p>
        <p>Inside the city, Troy lay in uneasy sleep. Orpheon did not.</p>
        <p>He had been left for dead in an alley, propped against a crumbling wall, his blood seeping into the dust. His
          body ached, his breaths were shallow, but he had not yet let go. Not yet.</p>

        <p>His eyelids fluttered. Somewhere beyond the haze of pain, the sounds of movement stirred the night—wood
          creaking, whispers carried on the wind, the unmistakable rasp of metal against metal. He forced himself to
          focus.</p>
        <p>Then he heard it—the hollow thud of something shifting inside the wooden horse.</p>
        <p>He exhaled sharply.</p>
        <p>Of course. Of course Cassandra had been right.</p>
        <p>He let his head drop back against the wall, staring up at the stars. The gods must have been laughing
          themselves sick. He could almost hear Athena’s smug voice whispering, See?</p>
        <p>Straining, he turned his head slightly, catching a glimpse of the square through his blurry vision. The belly
          of the horse had opened, and dark figures were spilling out like ants from a rotted log. They moved swiftly,
          silently, knives glinting under the moonlight. The gates of Troy would be open within minutes.</p>
        <p>He tried to move. His body disagreed.</p>
        <p>He let out a weak, bitter laugh. “Well,” he muttered to the empty street, “that went well.”</p>
        <p>The first screams shattered the quiet.</p>

        <p>The Greeks swarmed through the city like water through cracked stone, slipping through corridors, slitting
          throats before the alarm could truly rise. By the time the Trojans realized what was happening, it was already
          too late.</p>
        <p>Flames licked at the rooftops, their glow staining the sky a sickly orange.</p>
        <p>Orpheon watched from where he lay, the heat of the fires reaching even him. Shadows darted past, the scent of
          blood and smoke thick in the air.</p>
        <p>Somewhere above, the gods watched.</p>
        <p>On Olympus, Athena stood with her arms crossed, a victorious smirk tugging at the corner of her lips.
          Poseidon was silent, his expression unreadable. Apollo sat in the corner, plucking absently at his lyre, his
          usual amusement dulled by something he couldn’t quite name.</p>
        <p>Orpheon, barely clinging to life, forced his gaze upward, past the chaos, past the flames. He looked toward
          the heavens, his lips parting in something that was almost a smile, almost a grimace.</p>
        <p>His voice was barely a whisper.</p>
        <p>“Was it always meant to be?”</p>
        <p>Athena tilted her head, as if considering the question. Then, softly, almost as if she regretted it, she
          murmured, “Fate may be written… but it is mortals who must suffer it.”</p>
        <p>As the city burned, the Fates whispered over the dying warrior’s body.</p>
        <p>One thread.</p>
        <p>One choice.</p>
        <p>One end.</p>
        <p>And so, the last omen came to pass.</p>
