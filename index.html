          Troy had been at war for ten years, and it showed. The streets
          sagged under the weight of suffering, the stones worn smooth not by
          time, but by the desperate footsteps of men who no longer believed
          they would live to see peace. Smoke curled in the distance, an
          ever-present reminder that even when the fighting paused,
          destruction did not.

          Orpheon sat on the temple steps, sharpening his sword with slow,
          methodical strokes. His armor was scratched and dull, his face
          unshaven, his spirit just as worn. War had a way of grinding men
          down, not in a single strike, but through a thousand little losses,
          each one chipping away at something that once resembled hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          He muttered under his breath, half to himself, half to the silent
          gods above: they were already ghosts. The war would not kill them in
          one swift blow—it would reduce them to dust, grain by grain, until
          nothing remained. His moment of quiet was shattered by hurried
          footsteps. Cassandra burst into view, her dark hair wild, her breath
          coming fast. Her eyes, wide and fevered, carried the kind of
          certainty that made men uncomfortable. She had seen something.
          Without hesitation, she grabbed Orpheon's arm, her fingers digging
          into his skin as she tried to steady her breath. The Greeks hadn't
          left, she told him. They were inside the horse. Orpheon barely
          looked up, his eyes flicking toward the massive wooden structure
          that loomed in the city square.

          A gift, the elders had called it. A sign that Athena had finally
          turned her favor toward Troy. If that were true, then the goddess
          had an odd sense of generosity. His voice was dry when he finally
          spoke. The Greeks, rather than sailing home to their wives after ten
          years of war, had decided to curl up inside a wooden horse instead?
          He supposed that meant they weren't in a rush to get back to their
          families. Cassandra didn't rise to the joke. Her grip on his arm
          tightened. She had seen it, she insisted. The moment the city slept,
          the Greeks would spill out of their hiding place like rot from a
          carcass. Orpheon sighed and rubbed his face, exhaustion pressing
          against him from all sides.

          He reminded her that no one listened to her. It wasn't personal—it
          was just that her timing had always been unfortunate. She could tell
          a man he was on fire, and he still wouldn't believe it until his own
          eyebrows had burned away. Her eyes darkened. Had she ever spoken
          falsehoods? No, Orpheon admitted. But that didn't mean anyone wanted
          to hear the truth. Cassandra took a step closer, lowering her voice.
          The city would burn, she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          They would not believe her until it was too late—until the flames
          licked at their doorsteps and swallowed their screams. Orpheon
          exhaled slowly, glancing at the wooden horse once more. He didn't
          trust it. The Greeks were cunning, always twisting their games
          within games. And yet, the elders were desperate for peace, grasping
          at anything that resembled salvation. If Orpheon spoke out, what
          would it change? He asked her, quietly, what she wanted him to do.
          If he spoke against the king, they would call him a traitor. Even if
          he did, no one would listen. Cassandra's fingers tightened around
          his wrist. No, she said. They wouldn't listen. But he was not just a
          voice—he was a warrior. He could act. The words settled between
          them. Orpheon glanced toward the palace, where Priam and the elders
          feasted, toasting to Athena's so-called gift. Laughter echoed
          through the streets, brushing against the walls of a city that would
          not stand for much longer. His fingers curled around his sword hilt.
          Somewhere in the distance, the wooden horse stood still, waiting.
