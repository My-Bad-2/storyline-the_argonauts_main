          The night air hung thick over Troy, heavy with the scent of burning oil and the stale remnants of too many
          feasts. The city square was alive with flickering torchlight, the warm glow casting long shadows across the
          massive wooden horse that loomed in its center. The thing was absurd—too large, too still, too perfect. It
          stood like a guest that no one quite knew how to entertain, its presence both an omen and a spectacle.

          Orpheon stood at the edge of the crowd, arms crossed over his chest, watching. He had spent ten years fighting
          the Greeks, and if there was one thing he had learned, it was this: they never gave gifts. Not unless those
          gifts came with a knife in the back.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed and rubbed his face, his fingers brushing over the scruff on his jaw. He was too tired for this. Too
          tired for another night of pretending everything was fine. And yet, here they were, celebrating a giant wooden
          horse like it was a long-lost friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          He took a step forward, clearing his throat. “This is a terrible idea,” he said, loud enough for those nearest
          to hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few heads turned.

          Orpheon exhaled and raised his voice. “Do you all hear yourselves? We've spent a decade fighting these people,
          and suddenly, they just… leave us a nice little gift before they go? A perfectly crafted, beautifully
          polished, enormous wooden horse?” He gestured toward it. “We are not a nation of carpenters, and yet none of
          you find this suspicious?”
        </p>
        <p>
          A murmur rippled through the crowd, but it was more of an amused chuckle than genuine concern. Some of the
          younger soldiers smirked at each other, nudging elbows, as if this were just Orpheon being Orpheon—always too
          serious, always questioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned to one of them, exasperated. “Think about it. What do horses do?”
        <p>
          The man blinked at him. “…They run?”
        </p>
        <p>Orpheon groaned. “No. Well, yes, but that's not the point. Horses are used to transport things. To carry
          things. Like, I don't know… Greek warriors waiting to murder us in our sleep?”
        </p>

      <div class="inner">
        <p>Someone in the back snorted. A woman nearby shook her head, muttering something about war making men
          paranoid.</p>

        <p>Frustrated, Orpheon turned to the elder priests standing near the base of the horse. “At least tell me we've
          checked inside it.”</p>

        <p>One of the elders, an older man with a long white beard and an air of exaggerated wisdom, stepped forward
          with a patient smile. “My son, do you doubt the will of the gods? This is an offering to Athena, a symbol of
          our victory.”</p>

        <p>Orpheon felt his eye twitch. “No, what I doubt is our collective intelligence.”</p>

        <p>The elder gave him the kind of patronizing look reserved for unruly children. “We cannot question a gift from
          the gods. It would be blasphemy.”</p>

        <p>Orpheon turned to the sky and muttered, “And yet somehow, stupidity is perfectly acceptable.”</p>

        <p>He glanced toward the palace. Cassandra would be watching from somewhere in the shadows, waiting to see if he
          would act. He could still hear her voice in his mind—You are a warrior. You can act.</p>

        <p>He clenched his fists.</p>

        <p>“To the pit with it,” he said under his breath. Then, louder, “Fine. If none of you will listen, I'll handle
          this myself.”</p>

        <p>He reached for his sword, intent on driving it into the wooden beast—when a sudden movement stopped him.</p>

        <p>A figure stepped forward from the crowd—Deiphobus, one of Priam's sons, his face set with disapproval. The
          man was a good fighter, but more importantly, he was a good politician. He had a knack for siding with whoever
          had the most influence, and tonight, that meant standing with those who welcomed the horse.</p>

        <p>Deiphobus narrowed his eyes. “You would dishonor Athena's gift, Orpheon?” His voice carried, drawing the
          attention of more onlookers. “Would you spit in the face of the gods and undo what little hope we have left?”
        </p>

        <p>Orpheon met his gaze, unflinching. “Hope?” He laughed, the sound sharp. “Is that what we're calling this?
          Because to me, it looks like a death trap on stilts.”</p>

        <p>Murmurs grew louder. The crowd was shifting, some entertained, others unsettled.</p>

        <p>Deiphobus stepped closer, lowering his voice just enough that only Orpheon could hear. “Watch your tongue.
          The people need something to believe in. Do not take that from them.”</p>

        <p>Orpheon's grip on his sword tightened. “And if their belief leads them to ruin?”</p>

        <p>Deiphobus' expression didn't waver. “Then at least they'll meet their end with hope, instead of fear.”</p>

        <p>Orpheon stared at him. For a moment, he considered driving his blade into the horse anyway—consequences be
          damned.</p>

        <p>Then something sharp and hot pierced his side.</p>

        <p>His breath caught. He staggered, looking down to see the dark stain of blood blooming against his tunic. A
          spear jutted from his ribs, its tip glistening under the torchlight.</p>

        <p>The world tilted. The noise of the crowd became distant, muffled, like sound traveling through water.</p>

        <p>He barely registered the faces around him, some horrified, some indifferent. He tried to speak, but his mouth
          tasted like iron.</p>

        <p>As he sank to his knees, Cassandra's voice drifted through the haze, quiet, resigned. Fate is cruel to those
          who try to escape it.</p>

        <p>Orpheon coughed, a weak, bitter laugh escaping his lips. Fools. All of them. And then the world faded to
          black.</p>
